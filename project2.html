  <h2 class="project1secondheadings">Overview</h2>
  <p>This website represents all the projects I have completed in Year 11 Digital Technology. You will also see my design considerations, development and implications. You'll see my progression throughout the creation of the project. Character: This character is roughly 47 years old, he was born in Ghana, West Africa. The character's name is Kojo Abeeku. He actively works as Senior Partner at B&P Assosciates. Kojo enjoys playing Basketball in his free time, he is very skilled in cooking, as he grew up in a poor household where he was needed every night to cook food. Kojo is married to his wife, Afafa Abeeku, and his 2 children are Adzo Abeeku, and Amma Abeeku. Kojo suffered from Anorexia but is currently recovering.</p> <br>

  <h1 class="project1headings">End Users</h1>
  <p>Our end users are primarily children. This is because Tic Tac Toe is more of a fun, quick-paced and quick game. 
    We will be designing it specifically for users aged 8-16, so this means the language will need to be simple enough for 
    everyone to understand.

<section id="implications">
  <h1 class="project1headings">Implications</h1>
  
  <h2>Functionality</h2>
  <p>Within the game of Tic Tac Toe, functionality is ensuring that the game itself actually works.
    This means that everything should work as intended and no errors occur in the code.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphunderline">How I will address this:</p>
   <li class="implicationsli">I will address this implication by playing through the game multiple times and testing
    every part of the game to ensure it is functional.
   </li>
  <li class="implicationsli">I can also double check the functionality by reading the code and seeing if there
    are any errors that need to be fixed.
  </li>

  <h2>Usability</h2>
  <p>The usability of a Tic Tac Toe game is ensuring that the game is easy and simple to use. 
    We need to ensure that our users can easily understand how the game works and that it is not too complicated
    to use.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphunderline">How I will address this:</p>
  <li class="implicationsli">I will get feedback from people in my class on how easy it is to use.</li>
  <li class="implicationsli">I will also give users the instructions so they can read them and see if they're
    easy to understand.
  </li>

  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <P>Privacy is all about keeping a users personal details that they woudln't want being shared safe. This means 
    their name, phone, card, etc. For our game, it would mostly just be their name that needs to be kept safe.
  </P>
  <p class="paragraphunderline">How I addressed them:</p>
  <li class="implicationsli">We will ensure the privacy of the users name as it is not stored in a computer, instead it is in 
    a variable that is deleted once the application is closed.
  </li>
